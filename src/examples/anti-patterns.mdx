# Zustand Anti-patterns

Zustand is powerful, but its flexibility can easily cause problems in codebases.

The documentation shows 3 ways to read state, and 4 ways to update state! Many of these approaches have hidden performance issues.

Using `zustand-refined` avoids most of these issues, but you should still be aware of these problems, so you can be sure to create a performant application.

## Bears Example

We will use this example from the Zustand docs:

```ts
import { create } from "zustand";
const useBears = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increaseBears: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
  updateBears: (newBears) => set({ bears: newBears }),

  // This also comes from Zustand docs:
  fishes: 0,
  increaseFishes: () => set((state) => ({ fishes: state.fishes + 1 })),
}));
```

## There are 3 ways to read state

With the above store, there are 3 ways to retrieve the state:

```tsx
export function Bears1() {
  const bears = useBears.getState().bears;
  return <div>Bears: {bears}</div>;
}
export function Bears2() {
  const { bears } = useBears();
  return <div>Bears: {bears}</div>;
}
export function Bears3() {
  const bears = useBears((s) => s.bears);
  return <div>Bears: {bears}</div>;
}
```

Can you spot which approaches above are problematic?

- ‚õîÔ∏è `Bears1` didn't actually use the hook to access `bears`, so our component won't rerender when it changes.

  <Canvas of={Stories.Bears1} />

- ‚õîÔ∏è `Bears2` subscribes to ALL state updates. This might not be very visible right now, since `bears` is the only state value. But imagine we add `fishes` to our state; updates to `fishes` will cause `Bears2` to rerender.

  <Canvas of={Stories.Bears2} />

- üíö `Bears3` is implemented "correctly", because it uses a selector to pick the state it needs. It will only rerender when the `bears` value changes! Using a selector ensures we minimize the rerendering. This is great.

  <Canvas of={Stories.Bears3} />

  ‚ö†Ô∏è BUT WAIT, even this approach comes with trouble!

  - The selector is optional in the `useBears` hook.
  - The raw store is exposed to the consumer.
  - Some selectors need to be wrapped with Zustand's `useShallow` for them to work correctly.

So all 3 approaches are problematic, to varying degrees!

## 4 ways to update state

With the Bears example, there are 4 ways to update state!

```tsx
function IncreaseBears1() {
  const increaseBears = () => useBears.setState((s) => ({ bears: s.bears + 1 }));
  return <button onClick={increaseBears}>More Bears!</button>;
}
function IncreaseBears2() {
  const increaseBears = useBears.getState().increaseBears;
  return <button onClick={increaseBears}>More Bears!</button>;
}
function IncreaseBears3() {
  const { increaseBears } = useBears();
  return <button onClick={increaseBears}>More Bears!</button>;
}
function IncreaseBears4() {
  const increaseBears = useBears((s) => s.increaseBears);
  return <button onClick={increaseBears}>More Bears!</button>;
}
```

Again, can you spot the problematic components above?

- ‚ö†Ô∏è `IncreaseBears1` is terrible code. There's no encapsulation. The component has to implement Zustand-specific APIs, and must know how the state is stored and updated.

  <Canvas of={Stories.IncreaseBears1} />

- ‚ö†Ô∏è `IncreaseBears2` is not terrible, but the `getState()` call is a code smell ... you're NOT supposed to **read** state this way, so why would you **update** state this way?

  <Canvas of={Stories.IncreaseBears2} />

- ‚õîÔ∏è `IncreaseBears3` is actually **BAD**! This component will now rerender whenever the state is updated.

  <Canvas of={Stories.IncreaseBears3} />

- ‚ö†Ô∏è `IncreaseBears4` is also a code smell. The `increaseBears` method should not require a hook call; putting actions behind a hook makes your components needlessly more complex. Grabbing multiple actions is also quite cumbersome.
  <Canvas of={Stories.IncreaseBears4} />

Again, all 4 approaches are problematic, to varying degrees.

## How `zustand-refined` prevents these anti-patterns

Implementing this same store with `zustand-refined` is very easy! It simply requires you to **separate** the `store`, the `hooks`, and the `actions`:

```tsx
import { createGlobalState } from "zustand-refined";

const [{ useBears }, bearsActions] = createGlobalState({
  store: () =>
    createStore(() => ({
      bears: 0,
      fishes: 0,
    })),
  hooks: (useStore) => ({
    // Do not expose any "selector" logic; just export a simple `useBears()` hook
    useBears: () => useStore((s) => s.bears),
    useFishes: () => useStore((s) => s.fishes),
  }),
  actions: (setState) => ({
    // Actions are not part of the state, they're kept separate:
    increaseBears: () => setState((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
    removeAllBears: () => setState({ bears: 0 }),
    updateBears: (newBears) => setState({ bears: newBears }),
    increaseFish: () => setState((state) => ({ fishes: state.fishes + 1 })),
  }),
});

function Bears5() {
  // üíö There's no need use selectors here:
  const bears = useBears();
  return <span>Bears: {bears}</span>;
}
function IncreaseBears5() {
  // üíö No need for any hooks; these global actions are defined outside the React lifecycle
  return <button onClick={bearsActions.increaseBears}>More Bears!</button>;
}
```

<Canvas of={StoriesImproved.NoAntiPatternsHere} />

Here's how `zustand-refined` solves these anti-patterns:

1. **Encapsulation**: all Zustand implementation details are encapsulated. You only expose custom `hooks` for reading state, and custom `actions` for setting it.
2. The raw `getState()`, `setState()`, and `useStore(selector)` methods are never exported. You can only access them internally.
3. The `store` configuration contains just the state.
4. The `actions` configuration encapsulates the `setState()` method, and exposes your own actions.
5. The `hooks` configuration encapsulates the `useStore(selector)` hook, and exposes your own hooks.
6. When creating specific hooks, you determine how to use selectors, and you also are responsible for memoizing the selector values (using Zustand's `useShallow` when necessary).
7. `actions` are easy to use, and will NEVER cause rerenders!

- For global state, Actions are returned as **static methods**, which are easy to import and call without using any hooks.
- For Provider-based state, the `useActions()` hook returns all the actions. The actions are static, and will NEVER cause rerenders.
